            <br/>
            Thank you for your enquiry about extending the Lease for the above property.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            All flat leaseholders currently have the right to obtain a statutory lease extension which is a "one size
            fits all" solution which adds 90 years to your unexpired term and reduces your ground rent to a nil rent.
            This current statutory process requires the flat leaseholder to pay the landlord's professional valuation
            costs and reasonable conveyancing costs, on top of the flat leaseholder's own professional costs.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            I have personally been involved in over 200 lease extensions granted by private treaty over the last
            30 years. It is my personal view as a layman that all of these lease extensions involved the flat
            leaseholder in far lower costs than the statutory procedure and also that the total premium paid was less
            than what would likely have been paid under the statutory process.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            If you were to obtain a statutory lease extension under the current legislation, your new lease would be
            for 150.31 years from today at a peppercorn rent and the premium would include you paying me one half of
            the "marriage value" (the difference in market value between that with the current lease and that with a
            new lease for 125 years or more at a nil ground rent).
            <br/>
            <br/>
            I have always tried to advise my flat leaseholders fairly and I draw to your attention that the government
            recently announced proposed new legislation in respect of residential flat leases. It appears that the
            new legislation will mean all flat lease extensions will have to be be done by way of a new lease for a
            term of 990 years at a nil annual ground rent, with no alternatives offered. It also appears that the new
            legislation will remove the freeholder's right to half the marriage value. I stress that these are my
            assumptions as a layman. We do not know how long the new legislation will take to come into effect and what
            it will eventually comprise.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            In view of everything I have explained above and if I were you, I would probably wait to see when the new
            legislation comes into effect and what it comprises. Having made that clear, I am aware that many of our
            flat leaseholders do not wish to wait, possibly indefinitely. In view of this, we have decided to offer
            all our tenants significantly improved terms over what we were offering before the recent government
            announcements, in case any of our tenants might wish to proceed now on these significantly improved terms
            rather than wait to see what the future holds.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            We can offer you the following options, all available to a purchaser, in case you might wish to offer the
            flat for sale with a choice of lease extension. Our records show your lease as currently having
            {{ variables.unexpired }} years unexpired. The following proposals are based upon us estimating your
            flat's current market value to be about {{ variables.unimpvalue }} with the existing lease and about
            {{ variables.impvalue }} with a new long lease at a modest ground rent:
            <br/>
            <br/>
            1. A lease extension to provide a new term of 250 years from 2021 at a new ground rent of
            {{ variables.gr_new }} per annum fixed throughout the new term for a consideration of
            {{ variables.leq200R }}
            <br/>
            <br/>
            2. A lease extension to provide a new term of 250 years from 2021 at a new nil ground rent fixed throughout
            the new term for a consideration of {{ variables.leq200P }}.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            At the point that you or a prospective purchaser might wish to proceed, all we will require is a
            non-returnable deposit of Â£350.00 towards our costs of drafting the chosen lease extension and providing
            this to your solicitor. This sum is payable in addition to the consideration mentioned above but
            there are no other costs or charges payable to us. We strongly suggest that you use a solicitor to advise
            you and to register your extended lease.
