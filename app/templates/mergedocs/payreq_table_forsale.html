			<td> <strong> Alternatively, purchase your %TenureType% </strong> - There are many advantages to be gained by buying out your %TenureType%. In many cases, a householder cannot insure, extend or alter without the consent of the %TenureType% owner, which can sometimes involve significant costs. If you purchase your %TenureType% from us, such restrictions will no longer apply. Our all inclusive price, to include all our legal costs and a final adjustment for rent (overpaid or underpaid as appropriate) is shown on the right. There is nothing further to pay. This quotation is valid for 35 days.
