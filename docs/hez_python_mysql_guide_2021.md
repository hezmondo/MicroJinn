# Hez python, mysql server and workbench installation guide - updated by Hez 9th May 2021:

**Windows**

Download the small msi installer for myql 8.0.24

Install python 3.9.4 64 bit, ticking all users, which will choose location C:\Program files\Python39

Install myql server, mysql workbench and mysql python connector, all 8.0.24 64 bit, using SHA authentication and setting a strong password for root

open cmd prompt as administrator an do this to get into mysql console:

	cd C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin

	mysql -u root -p

Enter password: YxxxJxxx14!


**Linux**

Install mysql 8.0.23:

	sudo apt-get update -y
	sudo apt-get install mysql-server
	sudo mysql_secure_installation

set a full strength 10 character password for root with one or more special characters

Now enter the mysql console with this command using your password for root:

	sudo mysql

**Once in the mysql console in a terminal or command window:**

now we create a new user named hezm:

	CREATE USER 'hezm'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'YxxxJxxx14!';

Grant all permissions to hezm and also grant access:

	GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'hezm'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;

When finished making your permission changes, itâ€™s good practice to reload all the privileges with the flush command!

	FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

To show permissions for a MySQL User:

	SHOW GRANTS FOR 'hezm'@'localhost';

now we can create an empty database:

	CREATE SCHEMA mjinn; 

To import and export sql dumps or sql files, best use full path file names.

To execute a sql file on the desktop:

	use mfit;	
	source ~/Desktop/fitnessdump.sql;

To dump a backup file to the desktop:

	mysqldump fitness > ~/Desktop/fitnessdump2.sql;

To exit mysql console:

	exit;

**to install workbench in linux**

install workbench from the KDE software application manager (which contains snap apps) or:

	sudo snap install mysql-workbench_community

We now need to change from kwallet to gnome keyring:

	sudo apt-get update -y	
	sudo apt install gnome-keyring

Now uninstall kwallet using the software application manager.

We have installed MySQLWorkbench as a Snap package and want to store the database password(s) in the Gnome Passwords & Keys facility.
However, a Snap package is sandboxed; it is not by default allowed to access this service. When we choose "Store in keychain" MySQLWorkbench is blocked by AppArmor.
You need to enter a command to allow this package to access the service. The command is:

	sudo snap connect mysql-workbench-community:password-manager-service :password-manager-service

now restart and try again to add a connection for hezm, which should now work fine


**python_jinn for Windows**

for Lulu, install the required python dependencies using pip -r with a text filefrom C:\flask\mjinn:

	pip install -r lulu_dependencies.txt
	
or

	


for Jinn, best install the required python dependencies individually and carefully:

	pip install pyqt5==5.15.2
	pip install PyQtWebEngine
	pip install mysql-connector-python
	pip install dateutils
	pip install openpyxl
	pip install python-docx

NB - to make it all work, you must get the drivers for Qt_15.2 from thecodemonkey86 and place libmysql.dll in C:\Windows and 
C:\Jinn\Code\DLLs and qsqlmysql.dll in C:\Program Files\Python39\Lib\site-packages\PyQt5\Qt5\plugins\sqldrivers\

 	cd  C:\Jinn	
	python Code/home.py --version
	python Code/home.py


**python_jinn for Linux**

for Lulu just 

	cd C:\flask\mjinn
	pip install -r lulu_dependencies.txt

For Jinn, your linux may well have pyqt5 and possibly PyQtWebEngine already installed, but otherwise:

Install these python dependencies using apt_get:

	sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt5
	sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt5.qtsql
	sudo apt-get install libqt5sql5-mysql

and these using pip3

	pip3 install PyQtWebEngine
	pip3 install dateutils
	pip3 install openpyxl
	pip3 install python-docx
	pip3 install mysql-connector-python

then check versions and start Jinn

	python3 /home/richard/Jinn/Code/home.py --version
	python3 /home/richard/Jinn/Code/home.py
