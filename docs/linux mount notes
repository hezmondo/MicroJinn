Listing Unmounted Partitions

To address the listing of the unmounted partitions part, there are several ways - lsblk, fdisk, parted, blkid

One could use a little bit of AWK magic to parse output of lsblk to list all the unmounted partitions :

    lsblk  --noheadings --raw | awk '$1~/s.*[[:digit:]]/ && $7==""'

sda1 8:1 1 3.8G 0 part
sdb4 8:20 0 6.8G 0 part
sdb2 8:18 0 1M 0 part
sdb5 8:21 0 213.5G 0 part
sdb3 8:19 0 300M 0 part
sdb1 8:17 0 2.9G 0 part

Mounting Partitions

I've found that mount can be pickyï¼š it needs to know exact filesystem, it needs to be run as root, etc. udisksctl mount -b /dev/sXY is a much better command, can be ran as regular user, and mounts automatically to the /media/$USER/ folder. For example,

    udisksctl mount -b /dev/sdb3

Mounted /dev/sdb3 at /media/richard/073A-5DCF
